Version Notes (Current Version: v1.3)
=======================================
v1.3 (Pre-release)
-----------


v1.2
------------
1. Support Liquid template, templates ending with `.liquid` are considered as using liquid templating language. Liquid contains `include` tag to support partials, we follow the ruby partials naming convention to have `_<partialName>.liquid` as partial template. A custom tag `ref`, e.g. `{% ref file1 %}` is introduced to specify the resource files that current template depends on.
2. DFM include syntax is updated to use `[!include[<title>](<filepath>)]` syntax
3. Disable glob pattern in `docfx metadata` command line option as it is to some extent confusing, consider using a `-g` option later to re-enable it.

v1.1
-------------
1. Rewrite Glob
    The syntax of glob is:
    1. `**` is called globstar, it matches any number of characters, including `/`, as long as it's the only thing in a path part.
    2. If `**` is right behind `/`, it is a shortcut for `**/*`.
    3. `*` matches any number of characters, but not `/`
    4. `?` matches 1 characters, but not `/`
    5. `{}` allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions, e.g. `{a,b}` => `a` and `b`
    6. `!` at the beginning of a pattern will negate the match
    7. `[...]` matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range
    8. `/` is considered as path separator, while `\` is considered as escape character
2. Support `fileMetadata`. You can specify different metadata value using glob pattern
3. Improve overwrite functionality.
    Now you can overwrite not only summary/remarks, but also descriptions for parameters. You can even add exceptions.
4. Now the latest project.json projects are also supported in DNX version.
5. Simple code snippet is now supported, syntax is `[!code-REST-i[title](path "optionalTitle")]`
6. Url is now encoded in markdown link.
