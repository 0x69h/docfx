#Generate your API documentation with DocFX

![Appveyor]()


##What is it?
DocFX makes it extremely easy to generate your developer hub, complete with API reference, landing page, and how-to.
There are currently two versions of the tool:

* Windows specific IDE version which uses .NET Framework and works with [VS 2015 community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
* Cross platform console version which uses .NET Core and DNX

We currently support C# and VB projects.
